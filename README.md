## 👋 Hey there! Welcome to my QA Portfolio

I'm a driven Manual QA Tester with a passion for uncovering bugs and ensuring seamless user experiences in software products. Fresh from completing GenofIT's theoretical Manual Testing course—covering everything from SDLC/STLC fundamentals to the 7 principles of testing—I've leaped into their QA Manual Pro practical program, a 30-day intensive hands-on training. This fast-tracked journey transformed my knowledge into real-world skills, working on anonymized live projects under mentorship from senior QA pros at international companies. It's been an exciting ride, blending structure with a bit of "bug-hunting adventure" to keep things fun while delivering top-notch quality assurance.

### 🚀 My QA Journey Highlights

- **Week 1:** Mastered professional documentation standards (ISTQB, IEEE 829), crafting bug reports with laser-focused titles, clear steps, visuals (hello Loom!), and severity/priority. I even use AI prompts (ChatGPT/Claude) to make reports sparkle ✨.
- **Hands-On:** Built smoke/sanity testing checklists, test cases/scenarios with traceability matrices (RTM) – sharpening my attention to detail, and already started this GitHub portfolio to showcase my real-world artifacts.
- **Frontend Fun:** Validated HTML/CSS, tamed browser quirks, tested responsiveness, and tackled accessibility like a digital superhero (WCAG, WAVE, NVDA).
- **UI/UX Adventures:** Mapped user journeys, ran usability and A/B tests, and wielded tools like Playwright and Hotjar to banish design gremlins.
- **Backend Bossmode:** API Testing in Postman (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, status codes), authentication (JWT/Bearer Tokens), and basic SQL for solid data checks.
- **The QA Remix:** Exploratory, regression, functional, and edge-case testing all in agile settings, turning feedback sessions into engaging "defect detective" games—because QA can be fun and fierce!

### 😄 Fun Facts About Me

- I believe “every bug tells a story” — and some have epic plot twists!
- My favorite debugging tool: coffee ☕ and curiosity.
- I turn feedback sessions into “Defect Detective” challenges (who found the toughest bug this sprint?).
- If a design flaw could tank user satisfaction, you’ll find me (like a superhero in the shadows).
- I ethically use AI—but promise never to let a bot write my bug jokes.
