## 👋 Hey there! Welcome to my QA Portfolio

Hi, I'm a Manual QA Tester with a superpower for sniffing out sneaky bugs and making software AWESOME!  
Freshly equipped from adventure-packed training 🏕️ (theory, hands-on, real projects!), I blend QA wizardry 🎩 with a love for fun exploratory testing.  Whether I’m hunting bugs, perfecting docs, or adding sparkle with AI 🤖✨—I believe QA is best with curiosity, coffee ☕, and teamwork!  
My motto: “Quality first, bugs LAST!” 🚦.

### 🚀 My QA Journey Highlights

- Mastered professional documentation standards (ISTQB, IEEE 829), crafting bug reports with laser-focused titles, clear steps, visuals, and severity/priority✨.
- **Hands-On:** Built smoke/sanity testing checklists, test cases/scenarios with traceability matrices (RTM) – sharpening my attention to detail, and already started this GitHub portfolio to showcase my real-world artifacts.
- **Frontend Fun:** Validated HTML/CSS, tamed browser quirks, tested responsiveness, and tackled accessibility like a digital superhero (WCAG, WAVE, NVDA).
- **UI/UX Adventures:** Mapped user journeys, ran usability and A/B tests, and wielded tools like Playwright and Hotjar to banish design gremlins.
- **Backend Bossmode:** API Testing in Postman (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, status codes), authentication (JWT/Bearer Tokens), and basic SQL for solid data checks.
- **The QA Remix:** Exploratory, regression, functional, and edge-case testing all in agile settings, turning feedback sessions into engaging "defect detective" games—because QA can be fun and fierce!
